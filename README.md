# ping-pong-game
A 2D ping pong game for two players.

The red bar controls are the "W" and "S" keys for "Up" and "Down" movements respectively

While the blue bar controls are the Up and Down arrow keys. I really don't think their respective directions should be explained as well. But in case, Up key is for UP movement, while the Down key is for downwards movement
